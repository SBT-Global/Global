Q. Do you inspect the car before bidding?

A. Yes we do. Paz Japan has a highly skilled team of professionals who strictly inspect the vehicles before they decide to bid on it. We train our staff to first confirm that the actual condition and specification of the vehicle exactly match the information offered by the auction house.
